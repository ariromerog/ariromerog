### Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

This is my own little github profile. I'm loving it so far. 

## my .vimrc
I just started my journey into VIM and even though I'm still a complete newbie, I'm not going back to graphical IDEs. Feel free to use this .vimrc as starting point. 

Current features:
- Plugin management using vim plug.
- Autocompletion using YouCompleteMe.
- File navigatino using NERDTree.
- Auto closing matchin brackets, quotes and tags.
- Some useful keybindings.
